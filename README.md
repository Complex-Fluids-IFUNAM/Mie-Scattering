# Mie Scattering Repository
Welcome to our repository. We refer to Mie Scattering Theory as all solutions for wave scattering by a dielectric nonhomogeneous media, where Maxwell’s electromagnetic equations are solved with all the spatial components separately. This terminology is named after Gustav Mie, who developed a solution for plane wave scattering by a homogeneous dielectric sphere. Since this solution, other generalizations have been solved, such as plane wave scattering by a multi-layer dielectric sphere, where three consecutive layers don’t have the same dielectric properties. 

Here, we use the Mie Scattering theory to describe the light scattering by colloidal spheres, whose size is in the order of mesoscopic size (from a few nanometers to microns), immersed in a solvent. The particle’s light-scattering behavior is relevant to the study of new photonics and optics materials, where it is relevant to know the scattering cross-section, extinction, and backscattering efficiency, and the light scattering intensity as a function of scattering angle. We use light scattering techniques such as static light scattering, which measures the mean light scattering intensity by colloidal suspensions as a function of scattering angle. Other methods like UV-Vis spectrometry measure the light extinction by material slab as a function of wavelength. In all these cases, the Mie Scattering theory could be used to fit the size and dielectric parameters of the particles with experimental data and, before this, used to engineer particles with unique scattering properties. Recently, we published a paper that showed how to use the Mie Scattering theory for nonhomogeneous colloidal spheres.[^1]

Whatever the application, here you have two Mie Scattering programs to calculate the light scattering properties for homogenous and radial nonhomogeneous spheres. The first one uses the well-known Bohren and Huffman’s algorithm for homogeneous spheres[^2], and the second one uses Yang’s algorithm for multi-layer spheres [^3].
